Chain Agnostic Improvement Proposals (CAIPs) describe standards for blockchain projects that are not specific to a single chain.

The CAIPs are intended to be viewed and referenced at [chainagnostic.org](https://chainagnostic.org/) rather than on the current public git repository. To contribute, see the [Contributing file](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## CAIP Status Terms

- **Draft** - an CAIP that is undergoing rapid iteration and changes.
- **Review** - an CAIP that is done with its initial iteration and ready for review by a wide audience.
- **Accepted** - a core CAIP that has been in Review for at least 2 weeks and any technical changes that were requested have been addressed by the author.

## Namespaces

Previously there were specific CAIPs for what is now referred to as *namespaces*. 
Chain Agnostic [Namespaces](https://github.com/chainagnostic/namespaces) describe a blockchain ecosystem or set of ecosystems as a namespace, relying as much as possible on the CAIP specifications to minimize the research needed to interact with assets, contracts, and accounts in that namespace.
Where a namespace has been accepted by the editors, the former CAIPs have been superseded and ongoing specification should be continued there.
